### Context

In 2006, global concern was raised over the [rapid decline in the honeybee population](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-08/colony-collapse-ten-years-after-crisis-what-is-happening-to-bees/8507408), an integral component to American honey agriculture. Large numbers of hives were lost to Colony Collapse Disorder, a phenomenon of disappearing worker bees causing the remaining hive colony to collapse. Speculation to the cause of this disorder points to hive diseases and pesticides harming the pollinators, though no overall consensus has been reached. Twelve years later, [some industries are observing recovery](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-01/good-news-for-bees-as-numbers-recover-while-mystery-malady-wanes) but the [American honey industry is still largely struggling](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/05/14/dying-bees-could-mean-the-end-of-american-honey/?utm_term=.31aeb8175b56). The U.S. used to locally produce over half the honey it consumes per year. Now, honey mostly comes from overseas, with 350 of the 400 million pounds of honey consumed every year originating from imports. This dataset provides insight into honey production supply and demand in America by state from 1998 to 2012\.

### Data Variables

*   _numcol_: Number of honey producing colonies. Honey producing colonies are the maximum number of colonies from which honey was taken during the year. It is possible to take honey from colonies which did not survive the entire year
*   _yieldpercol_: Honey yield per colony. Unit is pounds
*   _totalprod_: Total production (numcol x yieldpercol). Unit is pounds
*   _stocks_: Refers to stocks held by producers. Unit is pounds
*   _priceperlb_: Refers to average price per pound based on expanded sales. Unit is dollars.
*   _prodvalue_: Value of production (totalprod x priceperlb). Unit is dollars.
*   Other useful information: Certain states are excluded every year (ex. CT) to avoid disclosing data for individual operations. Due to rounding, total colonies multiplied by total yield may not equal production. Also, summation of states will not equal U.S. level value of production.
